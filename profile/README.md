## Working group to design and develop a new CPython C API

**TODO: explain what is it**

TL;DR: the goal is to design as new C API inspired from HPy, with the idea of
writing one or more PEP which have chances to be accepted.


How to get involved:

  - [HPy discord server](https://discord.gg/xSzxUbPkTQ): currently communication between members happen here.

  - Monthly meetings: 1st thursday of the month at 10am Europe Time (CEST). [Calendar invite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/py-ni/.github/refs/heads/main/newcapi.ics)
